NA multitrack

First copy has endCosts on 
NA_link1b
NA_chorus2a	
NA_chorus2b ...
but no links to bridge

Second copy has no links from any other section(s) to bridge
Won't work with current version as unspecified transitions not chosen.
(might be OK a long next default next cost is consistent?!)

second copy does not have sections for first, so won't know where it is when it starts!

No lengths on R12 tracks

scene 'some YSP files and commands!!!' with unknown track.

scene 'NotAlone2' selectSections specifies track 'NotAlone1', but this will just try to use costs associated with NotAlone1

scene 'NotAlone3' starts track from beginning
scene 'NotAlone3' doesn't take account of previous point reached
